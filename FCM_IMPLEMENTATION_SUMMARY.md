## üì± Notification Flow

### **Guest Arrival Example:**

```
1. Security uploads guest at gate
   ‚Üì
2. API creates guest entry
   ‚Üì
3. API looks up resident's apartment
   ‚Üì
4. API retrieves resident's FCM/Expo token
   ‚Üì
5. API sends notification with data:
   {
     "type": "guest_arrival",
     "screen": "security/guest-waiting",
     "guestId": "123",
     "guestName": "John Doe",
     "apartmentId": "45"
   }
   ‚Üì
6. Resident receives notification
   ‚Üì
7. Resident taps notification
   ‚Üì
8. App opens to "security/guest-waiting" screen
   ‚Üì
9. Screen receives params via deep link
   ‚Üì
10. Guest details displayed! üéâ
```

## üöÄ How to Test

### **1. On Physical Device:**
```bash
npm start
# Scan QR code with phone
```

### **2. Check Tokens:**
Look for console logs:
```
‚úÖ Notifications registered successfully
FCM Token: fFZ...
Expo Token: ExponentPushToken[...]
‚úÖ Push tokens saved to backend
```

### **3. Send Test Notification:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "ExponentPushToken[YOUR_TOKEN]",
    "title": "üîî Test Notification",
    "body": "From Hommunity!",
    "data": {
      "type": "test",
      "screen": "user/home"
    },
    "channelId": "guest-arrival"
  }'
```

### **4. Test Guest Flow:**
1. Login as User (registers tokens)
2. Login as Security (different device)
3. Security uploads guest
4. User receives notification
5. Tap notification ‚Üí Opens guest screen

## üîê Production Deployment

### **Option 1: Expo Push (Recommended for now)**
‚úÖ Already configured and working!
- No additional setup needed
- Uses Expo's notification service
- Works with `expoPushToken`

### **Option 2: Firebase Admin SDK**
For full FCM control:
```bash
npm install firebase-admin
```
- Uncomment code in `mobile-api/helpers/fcmHelper.js`
- Add service account credentials
- Use `fcmToken` directly

### **Option 3: HTTP API**
For serverless environments:
```bash
npm install google-auth-library
```
- Uncomment HTTP API code
- Add service account JSON
- Use OAuth2 tokens
